Hello world!
This is a sample corpus for training a tokenizer.
BytePiece makes tokenization educational and transparent.
We can handle Unicode: 你好世界 🚀
Multiple languages work too: Hola mundo, Bonjour le monde.
The algorithm learns common patterns through byte pair encoding.
Frequent pairs get merged first.
This creates a vocabulary of subword units.
Hello world appears multiple times.
Common words like "the" become single tokens.
Rare words split into smaller pieces.
This is efficient for neural networks.
Tokenization is the first step in NLP.
Good tokenizers improve model performance.
BytePiece aims to be educational first.
Understanding tokenization deeply matters.
From characters to subwords to words.
The spectrum of granularity.
